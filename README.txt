PROJECT OVERVIEW:
----------------
This project implements a comprehensive Library Book Management System using 
four fundamental data structures in C programming language. The system provides
efficient book management operations including addition, deletion, searching,
and organization of library resources. Each data structure offers unique
advantages for different operational requirements of a library management system.

================================================================================

DATA STRUCTURES IMPLEMENTED:
----------------------------

1. ARRAY DATA STRUCTURE (Array.h & Array.c)
   - Fixed-size book storage implementation
   - Fast random access to book records
   - Efficient for small to medium-sized libraries
   - Functions: Insert, Delete, Search, Display, Sort

2. LINKED LIST DATA STRUCTURE (Linked_List.h & Linked_List.c)
   - Dynamic memory allocation for book records
   - Efficient insertion and deletion operations
   - Suitable for frequently changing book inventories
   - Functions: Add Node, Delete Node, Search, Traverse, Update

3. STACK DATA STRUCTURE (Stack.h & Stack.c)
   - LIFO (Last In, First Out) implementation
   - Useful for tracking recently added/accessed books
   - Undo operations for book transactions
   - Functions: Push, Pop, Peek, IsEmpty, IsFull, Display

4. QUEUE DATA STRUCTURE (Queue.h & Queue.c)
   - FIFO (First In, First Out) implementation
   - Manages book reservation and waiting lists
   - Handles book request processing in order
   - Functions: Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, Rear, IsEmpty, IsFull

================================================================================

SYSTEM FEATURES:
---------------

CORE FUNCTIONALITIES:
- Add new books to the library system
- Remove books from the inventory
- Search books by various criteria (ID, Title, Author, ISBN)
- Display all books in organized format
- Update book information
- Sort books by different parameters

ADVANCED OPERATIONS:
- Book reservation system using Queue
- Recently accessed books tracking using Stack
- Efficient search and retrieval using Arrays and Linked Lists
- Memory management optimization
- Data validation and error handling

================================================================================
